  "solar_maintext": "<span>Our solar farms</span> <span>provide</span> clean and renewable energy, <span>reducing the carbon footprint and promoting sustainable development</span>",
  "solar_subtext": "<span>We have installed over</span> 100,000 solar panels, <span>which generate over</span> 50 megawatts (MW) of energy annually. <span>This is equivalent to</span> reducing CO2 emissions by 25,000 tons per year, <span>which is comparable to planting</span> 1 million trees.",
  "solar_question1": "Do solar panels perform better on hot days?",
  "solar_answer1": "In areas where land is scarce, floating solar farms allow for the creation of renewable energy sources without occupying space needed for agriculture or other purposes. The cooling effect of water enables floating solar panels to operate more efficiently than on land. Most floating solar farms are installed on artificial lakes or reservoirs. For example, the world's largest floating solar farm, recently opened in China near the city of Huainan, is located on a former coal mining site that was flooded. By covering the surface of the water, floating solar farms reduce evaporation, conserving water.",
  "solar_question2": "Which solar farms are better â€” floating or ground-mounted?",
  "solar_answer2": "Floating farms are more efficient due to natural cooling and land conservation, but their installation and maintenance are more complex and expensive. Ground-mounted installations are simpler to install and maintain, but they require more land.",
  "solar_question3": "How complex is the installation of a solar station?",
  "solar_answer3": "The installation of a standard solar station is relatively simple thanks to its modular design and pre-built systems, provided that qualified specialists are involved.",

  "mining_question1": "What are the cooling requirements for mining farm equipment?",
  "mining_answer1": "During mining, equipment generates a significant amount of heat. Efficient cooling systems help maintain optimal operating temperatures and extend the equipment's lifespan. In regions with low temperatures, natural cooling can be utilized, whereas in hot climates specialized air conditioning and cooling systems are required.",
  "mining_question2": "How important is the location for a mining farm?",
  "mining_answer2": "Location is critical to the successful operation of a mining farm. Important factors include electricity costs, climate conditions for cooling equipment, internet connectivity, and regional regulations. For example, some countries offer preferential electricity rates for mining, making them attractive for establishing farms.",
  "mining_question3": "What are the electricity costs for cryptocurrency mining?",
  "mining_answer3": "Mining requires significant amounts of electricity, which is one of the major expenses. For some cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, energy consumption can be extremely high, making mining economically unfeasible in regions with expensive electricity.",

  "hydrogen": "Hydrogen Technologies",
  "hydrogen_subtitle": "<span>The future</span> of energy is based on <br /> innovative <span>hydrogen technologies</span>",

  "hydrogen_subtext": "<span>We are actively implementing</span> hydrogen fuel cell technology, <span>which helps reduce CO2 emissions</span> and <span>enhance environmental safety</span>. <span>Our hydrogen generation system</span> is safe and highly efficient.",
  "hydrogen_question1": "What are the different methods for producing hydrogen?",
  "hydrogen_answer1": "Hydrogen can be produced using various technologies, including water electrolysis, methane reforming, and biochemical processes. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages in terms of cost, environmental impact, and scalability.",
  "hydrogen_question2": "How safe is it to use hydrogen as a fuel?",
  "hydrogen_answer2": "Hydrogen is a high-energy fuel, but its storage and transportation can be challenging due to its explosiveness and low density. Modern technologies include the use of composite cylinders and specific safety measures to mitigate the risks.",
  "hydrogen_question3": "Can hydrogen replace traditional fuels?",
  "hydrogen_answer3": "Hydrogen is considered a promising alternative to fossil fuels because it produces no carbon dioxide emissions when burned. However, large-scale implementation of hydrogen technologies requires addressing issues related to infrastructure, production costs, and a sustainable source of energy for its production.",

  "wind": "Wind Turbines",
  "wind_subtitle": "<span>Wind energy</span> is a powerful resource <br /> for sustainable <span>power supply</span>",
